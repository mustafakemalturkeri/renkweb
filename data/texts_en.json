    "description": "<b>art-rock band pushing the boundaries of music</b>",
    "extendedDescription": "<p><b>Renk</b> is an <b>art-rock band</b> whose songs are a blend of melancholic and aggressive compositions with psychedelic elements. With an emphasis on visual experience as much as the musical, Renk strives to transmit emotions in every medium available.</p><br><p>The band's first single <b>'Sonsuz Karmaşa'</b> was released in 2016. The same year, the band made its <b>international debut in Gdansk, Poland</b> after touring the metropolitan cities of Turkey including Ankara, Istanbul, Eskişehir and Antalya.</p><br><p>Their latest release, <b>'Kıyı'</b>, shines as one of rare concept albums released in recent years. From hopeful melodies and dark ambient drones to uplifting progressive narratives and existential lyrics, Renk tells a <b>60 minutes long story of unhomeliness and estrangement with the world</b>.</p><br><h5><b>Band Members:</b></h5><p><b>Anıl Kahvecioğlu</b> - Vocals and Guitars<br><b>Gökhan Şensönmez</b> - Guitars<br><b>Kemal Türkeri</b> - Bass Guitars<br><b>Ekin Özek</b> - Saxophone & Keys<br><b>Eren Özgün</b> - Drums</p>"
